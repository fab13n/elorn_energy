Elorn Energy
============

I live on a Dutch barge, which can go off-the-grid. To support this,
there are multiple sources of electricity: shore electricity, solar panels,
fuel generator and batteries. This project aims to allow control and monitoring
of all this through a Raspberry Pi.

It's written in Lua, supported by [Mihini](http://iot.eclipse.org/mihini).
A significant part of the project will be about supporting 
[Victron Energy](http://www.victronenergy.com) devices, as that's what
I'm mostly equiped with.

It's all released under the MIT public License. So is Lua, and Mihini is
licensed under the equivalent Eclipse Distribution License.
